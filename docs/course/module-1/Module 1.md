## Learning styles

![Learning styles](/img/learning.jpg)

### What is it?

Learning styles were developed by Peter Honey and Alan Mumford, based upon the work of Kolb.
They identified that there are four distinct learning styles or preferences: Activist, Theorist; Pragmatist and Reflector.
When learning, each individual tends to have a natural preference and would often find learning easier if the style of learning matches their preference.


### Why is it important?

Knowing your own learning style will enable you to seek out activities that will help you learn to ensure you transfer and embed the learning taking place.
Being able to recognise the preferred learning styles in others will enable you to adopt your approach when training, coaching or communicating with members of your team.


### How do we use it?

By completing the Learning Styles Questionnaire – this will give you an indication of your preferred learning style.
We can use Learning Styles in a variety of ways to understand how people prefer to learn and also the best way in which we communicate with them.


### What else?

Whilst people will display a natural preference, this doesn’t mean they don’t use the other three styles to learn they just wouldn’t choose it as the best way to learn for them.

### Learning styles

**Activists** are those people who learn by doing. 
They need to be ‘hands-on’, to dive in with both feet first.

With an open-minded approach to learning, they’ll be involving themselves fully and without bias in new experiences.

- Brainstorming
- Problem-solving
- Group discussion
- Puzzles
- Competitions
- Role-play.

**Reflectors** learn by observing and thinking about what happened.

They may avoid leaping in and prefer to watch from the sidelines. Preferring to stand back and view experiences from a number of different perspectives, they collect data and take time to work towards an appropriate conclusion.

- Paired discussions
- Self-analysis questionnaires
- Personality questionnaires
- Time out
- Observing activities
- Feedback from others
- Coaching
- Interviews.

**Theorist** learners like to understand the theory behind the actions.

They need models, concepts and facts in order to engage in the learning process. Prefer to analyse and synthesise, drawing new information into a systematic and logical ‘theory’.

- Models
- Statistics
- Stories
- Quotes
- Background information
- Applying theories.

**Pragmatists** need to be able to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world.

Abstract concepts and games are of limited use unless they can see a way to put the ideas into action in their lives. As experimenters, they try out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work.

- Time to think about how to apply learning in reality
- Case studies
- Problem-solving
- Discussion.

## Leadership grid

### What is it?

Known as the Managerial Grid, or Leadership Grid, it was developed in the early 1960s by management theorists Robert Blake and Jane Mouton. 
It plots a manager’s or leader’s degree of task-centeredness versus her person-centeredness, and identifies the type of management they adopt and their level of concern for task and people.

### Why is it important?

It is often tempting to focus on the task in order to achieve the results but if there is little concern for your people you might find that task focus is just a short term management strategy.

### How do we use it?

The Blake Mouton Managerial Grid is based on two behavioural dimensions:

**Concern for People:** this is the degree to which a leader considers team members’ needs, interests and areas of personal development when deciding how best to accomplish a task.

**Concern for Results:** this is the degree to which a leader emphasises concrete objectives, organisational efficiency and high productivity when deciding how best to accomplish a task.

**Impoverished Management – Low Results/Low People**

The Impoverished or ‘indifferent’ manager is mostly ineffective. With a low regard for creating systems that get the job done, and with little interest in creating a satisfying or motivating team environment, his results are inevitably disorganisation, dissatisfaction and disharmony.

**Produce-or-Perish Management – High Results/Low People**

Also known as ‘authoritarian’ or ‘authority-compliance’ managers, people in this category believe that their team members are simply a means to an end. The team’s needs are always secondary to its  productivity.
This type of manager is autocratic, has strict work rules, policies and procedures, and can view punishment as an effective way of motivating team members. This approach can drive impressive production results at first, but low team morale and motivation will ultimately affect people’s performance, and this type of leader will struggle to retain high performers.

**Middle-of-the-Road Management – Medium Results/Medium People**

A Middle-of-the-Road or ‘status quo’ manager tries to balance results and people, but this strategy is not as effective as it may sound. Through continual compromise, he fails to inspire high performance and also fails to meet people’s needs fully. The result is that his team will likely deliver only mediocre performance.

**Country Club Management – High People/Low Results**

The Country Club or ‘accommodating’ style of manager is most concerned about her team members’ needs and feelings. She assumes that, as long as they are happy and secure, they will work hard.
What tends to be the result is a work environment that is very relaxed and fun, but where productivity suffers because there is a lack of direction and control.

**Team Management – High Production/High People**

According to the Blake Mouton model, Team Management is the most effective leadership style. It reflects a leader who is passionate about his work and who does the best he can for the people he works with.

Team managers commit to their organisation’s goals and mission, motivate the people who report to them, and work hard to get people to stretch themselves to deliver great results. But, at the same time, they’re inspiring figures who look after their teams. 

Someone led by a Team Manager feels respected and empowered, and is committed to achieving her goals.

Team managers prioritise both the organisation’s production needs and their people’s needs. They do this by making sure that their team members understand the organisation’s purpose, and by involving them in determining production needs.

### What else?

When faced with a situation and not sure what approach to use, take time to consider what needs to happen.
You might find it useful to replace the axis with Urgency (across the bottom) and Importance up the left hand side and consider how urgent the task is and how important it is to see what style of management you could adopt.

## Top ten leadership actions
1. Set the task of the team - put it across with enthusiasm and remind people of it often.
2. Be decisive and fair - be prepared to take tough decisions and be, and be seen to be, fair.
3. Plan the work, check its progress, design jobs and arrange work to encourage the commitment of individuals and the team.
4. Set individual targets after consulting, discuss with each person regularly, and appraise at least once  a year.
5. Delegate decision-making to individuals - if not, consult with those affected before you decide.
6. Communicate the importance of each person’s job, provide support and explain decisions to help  people apply them, and brief the team together monthly on progress, policy, people and points for action.
7. Train and develop all team members, practise equal opportunities, gain support for the rules and procedures, set an example, and discipline those who break them.
8. Serve people in the team and care for their well-being and safety, work alongside people, deal with  grievances promptly, and attend social functions.
9. Monitor action, learn from successes and mistakes, regularly walk round each person’s place of work, observe, listen and praise.
10. Be an inspiration to your team - lead by example and motivate your team to be the best they can be.

## What is leadership?

- Leadership is different to management
- Leadership is about behaviour first, skills second
- Good leaders are followed chiefly because people trust and respect them, rather than for the skills they possess
- Leadership relies more on qualities such as integrity, honesty, humility, courage, commitment, sincerity, passion, confidence, positive attitude, wisdom, determination, compassion and sensitivity
- Some people are born more naturally to leadership than others
- Most people don’t seek to be a leader
- Those who want to be a leader can develop leadership ability.

### The Difference between Leaders and Managers

Leaders are interested in direction, vision, goals, objectives, intention, purpose and effectiveness - doing the right thing
Managers are interested in efficiency, the how to, the day-to-day - doing things right.

**Leaders**

- Visionary
- Set direction - provide strategic thinking
- Challenges status quo
- Big picture thinker
- Take risks
- Initiate
- Goal driven
- People focus
- Inspire
- Prepared to be different
- Accept conflict and deal with it
- Prepared to be disliked
- Lead through power.

**Managers**

- Missionary
- Implement plans, convert plans to actions
- Support status quo
- Small chunk thinker
- Avoid risk
- Implement
- Target driven
- Task focus
- Maintain
- Fit in - match image
- Value harmony and avoid conflict
- Manage through consent
- Manage through position (status).

## Leadership framework

![Framework1](/img/framework1.jpeg)
![Framework1](/img/framework2.jpeg)

### What is it?

This framework summarises the characteristics of effective leaders, focusing on yourself, others and the organisation.


### Why is it important?

This is a comprehensive summary of desirable traits and attributes for effective leadership. Leadership can be an intangible concept and this model attempts to define some key characteristics which give a benchmark to strive towards.


### How do we use it?

This can be used as a self-assessment tool to assess your own attributes in relation to what is recognised as good practice. For example, it enables you to ask yourself ‘To what extent do I inspire others? What can I do to develop that?’


### What else?

This framework could also be used as the basis for feedback from your team members, colleagues and line manager - you could give them the framework and ask them, ‘What should I stop, start, and continue?’

## Leadership continuum

**Tells** - the manager's approach is to 'tell'

The manager would often ‘tell’ directing the team on what they need to do and giving little or no consideration for them being actively involved. It’s about focusing on the task and getting the task done.

**Sells** - the manager ‘sells’ what they’re going to do

At this stage the manager is beginning to consider their impact and whilst they’ll still take a ‘telling’ approach this will often be softened 
by an explanation as to why they should do something a certain way. Often giving them the benefits and reasons why not to do it the way the manager wants it to happen.

**Explains** – the manager‘explains’ why

If the manager tends to explain their approach, they’ll often provide the background as to why they want something done in a certain way and by explaining they’ll naturally allow their team to ask questions.

**Tests** - the manager invites discussion

A manager at this stage on the continuum has already identified the approach they want to take but is aware that their team could influence it and would often ‘test’ out their ideas with the team. At this stage, the team will start to feel more involved and more motivated.

**Selects** - the leader starts to include the team

At this stage you’ll start to see leadership behaviour becoming more apparent. Here the leader is working with their team, presenting them with situations or challenges and whilst they might guide them the purpose of this approach to generate discussion with the leader deciding on the final approach.

**Consults** - the leader starts to consult with their team

The Leader in you is beginning to show, your empowering your team to work with you to look at challenges, to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. You will of course still set the boundaries to work within but your team will start to take ownership and accountability.

**Joins** - the leader is working alongside their team

As you join with your team you’ll find that they take responsibility. They’ll solve their own problems, they’ll work with you, not for you and will all be driving for the same desired result.

## Differences between managers and leaders

**Leaders create a vision, managers create goals.**

Leaders paint a picture of what they see as possible and inspire and engage their people in turning that vision into reality. They think beyond what individuals do. They activate people to be part of something bigger. They know that high-functioning teams can accomplish a lot more working together than individuals working autonomously. Managers focus on setting, measuring and achieving goals. They control situations to reach or exceed their objectives.

**Leaders are change agents, managers maintain the status quo.**

Leaders are proud disrupters. Innovation is their mantra. They embrace change and know that even if things are working, there could be a better way forward. And they understand and accept the fact that changes to the system often create waves. Managers stick with what works, refining systems, structures and processes to make them better.

**Leaders are unique, managers copy.**

Leaders are willing to be themselves. They are self-aware and work actively to build their unique and differentiated personal brand. They are comfortable in their own shoes and willing to stand out. They’re authentic and transparent. Managers mimic the competencies and behaviours they learn from others and adopt their leadership style rather than defining it.

**Leaders take risks, managers control risk.**

Leaders are willing to try new things even if they may fail miserably. They know that failure is often a step on the path to success. Managers work to minimise risk. They seek to avoid or control problems rather than embracing them.

**Leaders are in it for the long haul, managers think short-term.**

Leaders have intentionality. They do what they say they are going to do and stay motivated toward a big, often very distant goal. They remain motivated without receiving regular rewards. Managers work on shorter-term goals, seeking more regular acknowledgment or accolades.

**Leaders grow personally, managers rely on existing, proven skills.**

Leaders know if they aren’t learning something new every day, they aren’t standing still, they’re falling behind. They remain curious and seek to remain relevant in an ever-changing world of work. They seek out people and information that will expand their thinking. Managers often double down on what made them successful, perfecting existing skills and adopting proven behaviours.

**Leaders build relationships, managers build systems and processes.**

Leaders focus on people – all the stakeholders they need to influence in order to realise their vision. They know who their stakeholders are and spend most of their time with them. They build loyalty and trust by consistently delivering on their promise. Managers focus on the structures necessary to set and achieve goals. They focus on the analytical and ensure systems are in place to attain desired outcomes. They work with individuals and their goals and objectives.

**Leaders coach, managers direct.**

Leaders know that people who work for them have the answers or are able to find them. They see their people as competent and are optimistic about their potential. They resist the temptation to tell their people what to do and how to do it. Managers assign tasks and provide guidance on how to accomplish them.

# Chairing and presenting

## Team briefings

Team briefing is a key tool for communicating with teams and giving them the motivation to achieve organisational goals.	

Team briefing is the process by which information generated by the organisation - in terms of objectives, results, policies and other factors - is cascaded through the management chain to achieve understanding and ownership amongst the entire workforce.

People need to understand:

- How their efforts contribute to the aims of the organisation
- Their tasks - what is expected of them and what standards they should achieve
- How well they are performing their roles
- The conditions under which they are employed - and any changes that might be made to those conditions of employment
- The policies and policy changes that might affect them.

People also need the opportunity to contribute their ideas for bringing about improvements. This helps to make the organisation more effective and creates greater job satisfaction.

Team Briefing is the ideal vehicle to accomplish all this and much more. The key benefits are shown below.

## The 4 P's of briefing

### What is it?

This model summarises the key topics to include in a team brief. These topics apply to both the core and local briefs.

### Why is it important?

It sets out a simple structure for the brief and covers the key points of information that may be included. It ensures that important information is not missed.

### How do we use it?

There are many potential topics that can be generated under these headings. 
Here are a few:

**Progress**

- Product sales
- Market share
- Financial results
- Waste reduction
- Safety data.

**People**

- Appointments/resignations
- Promotions
- Internal vacancies
- Internal/external visitors
- Training opportunities.

**Policy**

- Legislation
- New committees
- Procedural and process changes
- New documentation
- Changes in employee benefits.

**Points for Action**

- Subcontractors on site
- Suggestion scheme
- Holiday cover
- Security
- Emergency procedures.

### What else?

This model is a great way of dividing up the content of the team brief - it gives you a standard agenda for every team brief, making it easier for you to prepare. Team members will be able to assimilate the information more readily if they receive it in the same format every time.

## The dartboard model

### What is it?

A framework to help presenters prioritise thier content when planning a presentation.

**Must know**

The key points you are making and the essential information that supports and illustrates them.

**Should know**

This is information which supports the 'Must know' points and may include important background information or the bigger picture.

**Could know**

You will not cover during the session but may extend these areas when taking questions and in supporting handout material.

### Why is it important?

Presenters routinely make the mistake of trying to cover far too much content in the time they have available. This can result in content being cut out in the spur of the moment, anxiety for the presenter and/or the presentation taking longer than planned. None of these situations are desirable and they can be avoided by prioritising the content.

### How do we use it?

1. Start with a very clear presentation objective - this is an essential first step
2. Generate a list of points that are relevant to meeting your presentation objective
3. Review this list using the Dartboard Model and categorise each item as Must Know, Should Know or Could Know
4. Structure your presentation around the Must Know items; reserve your information about the Should Knows to cover if you have spare time or to deal with in the Q&A section of your presentation. Leave out the Could Knows as they are not central to meeting your presentation objective.

### What else?

A useful technique is to write your content ideas on sticky notes which you can then move around until you get them in the best sequence.

## The presentation diamond

### What is it?

A framework for structuring the presentation and allocating time to each of the key sections.

### Why is it important?

Presenters often make mistakes such as:

- Giving a long introduction and leaving little time for the actual content
- Giving little or no introduction and launching straight into the content
- Giving little or no summary at the end and ending the presentation abruptly.

Using the Presentation Diamond to structure the presentation ensures that appropriate time is allocated to the key sections and nothing important is missed.

### How do we use it?

Check how much time you have for your presentation and whether or not this includes time for questions
Calculate how much time you should allocate to each section of your presentation using the 10:80:10 ratio
Start with the Main Body: set out your key points in a logical sequence, allowing time for questions if appropriate
Identify what you want to say in your Introduction and Summary.

### What else?

This structure can be summarised with the following:

- Tell ‘em what you’re going to tell ‘em
- Tell ‘em
- Tell ‘em what you’ve told ‘em.
- 
This is the format used on television news programmes. The repetition helps the audience to remember the key points.

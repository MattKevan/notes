## Rapport triangle

![Rapport](/img/rapport.jpeg)

### What is it?

This model illustrates the steps involved in building true rapport and trust between people.

### Why is it important?

It reveals the level of communication for peak rapport to exist. It can be used to diagnose where individuals and the group are comfortable in their communications.

### How do we use it?

There are five levels on the triangle:

1. **Ritual and Cliché:** Ritual and cliché gives social permission for an interaction to take place symbolised by some form of ‘meet and greet’. In conversation terms this sounds like an initial chat about cliché issues (e.g. what happened on the Apprentice television show last night).
2. **Facts and Information:** Establish the purpose and format of the discussion and how its objectives will be achieved.
3. **Ideas and Judgements:** Ask for their views on each issue and share your own where relevant. Inviting the other party to express him/herself and make an informed judgement about what is going on represents a slightly ‘less safe’ level of communication given the speaker is exposing his/her ideas and judgements. Modelling higher levels of trust and respect enables freer movement up and down the triangle.
4. **Feelings:** Ask them/explain how you feel about this issue. This level, when prepared for by steadily climbing the triangle, supports risk taking in communication, such as hearing without judgement, handling resistance and enables you to go for the heart of the issue in a timely manner.
5. **Peak Rapport:** Here you display uninhibited communication without fear of reproach. The positive intent of the speaker is assumed. This positive spirit of interaction supports the notion of freedom of expression and acknowledges potential barriers and any distractions or inadequacies.

### What else?

When communications go wrong in influencing, the triangle’s focus on intent makes for a speedy recovery and helps retain emotionally intelligent communication skills.

## How to build rapport

**Find Common Ground**

- Greet the person or make a remark to break the ice
- Find something you have in common
- Use open-ended questions to discover some personal information about the person
- Show interest in their life, work, hobbies, etc.
- Be sincere.

**Show Empathy**

- Notice any signals which tell you something about how the other person is feeling
- Respond to those signals
- Aim to see things from their perspective.

**Mirror their Non-Verbal Communication**

- Carefully watch the person’s body language (including gestures and posture) and mirror it without being too obvious
- Mirror the other person’s language - e.g. use simple, direct words or technical language if they do
- Reiterate keywords or phrases that the other person has used
- Match their speech pattern in terms of vocal tone and volume
- Be subtle and be careful of mimicking the person.

**Remember the Basics**

- Shake hands firmly
- Look people in the eye
- Smile
- Hold your head up and maintain good posture
- Ask open-ended questions
- Be sincere
- Face the other person instead of looking at your computer screen or mobile device.

Note: these are the cultural norms in Western business and may not apply in every context.

**Re-establishing Rapport**

- Recognise when you have lost rapport and take steps to re-establish it
- Consider why you lost rapport in the first place - what did you say or do?
- Apologise if you need to
- Focus on rebuilding the trust - show genuine concern for their needs
- Apply the rapport building tips above.

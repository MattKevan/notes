## Performance management cycle

![Performance cycle](img/cycle.png)

What is it?
A cycle that outlines the approach that line managers should follow on an annual basis for every member of the team.

### Why is it important?

Following this cycle is important as it enables line managers to performance manage all members of their team, rather than focusing on the poor performers. Traditionally, managers focus 80% of their time on 20% of their team (i.e. the poor performers), but they should aim to allocate their time equally across the whole team.
### How do we use it?

Use this cycle to ensure you support, motivate and challenge the whole team throughout the year. This helps to ensure that everyone has absolute clarity as to what is expected of them to perform well, and enables the manager to provide support and on-going feedback to review and measure progress.
### What else?

An annual review of performance is the absolute minimum required to manage performance effectively. Best practice states that performance should be reviewed every second month, with a formal mid-year review included in the process.

## Smart objectives

By setting an objective, you are making it clear exactly what standards of performance you expect in future. SMART is a useful tool for setting clear objectives.

 
**Objectives should be:**


*Specific* - state exactly what performance standard is required (e.g. attend work; achieve quality standards; work with the team; etc.)

*Measurable* - include a measure of performance so that it is clear if the objective has been met or not (e.g. to x%; fully; accurate; by y amount; etc.)

*Agreed* - jointly by the manager and employee so that the employee makes a commitment to achieving it

*Realistic* - it must be an achievable and realistic objective or the employee may not even attempt to achieve it

*Timebound* - include a date by which the objective should be achieved (e.g. daily; weekly; monthly; by 23rd of the month; by x date; etc.)
 
### What is it?

A great tool for setting objectives.
### Why is it important?

Setting SMART objectives enables you to make it clear exactly what standards of performance you expect in the future from a team member. It sets out what is to be achieved and to what standard. It ensures that both the line manager and the job holder have a clear understanding and avoids potential confusion and misunderstanding. Crucially, it gives a measure of performance which should be followed up at a later date.
### How do we use it?

An example of how to set a SMART objective for a person who is persistently late for work might be:

* S - ‘Attend work…’
* M - ‘…on time, every day…’
* A - Ideally this would be agreed between the line manager and their team member.
* R - Any reasons why this couldn’t be achieved should be addressed.
* T - ‘…for two weeks’.

### What else?

Using the SMART criteria will help you review and measure the progress being achieved.

## Strategy and culture

### Strategy

A strategy is a long-term plan that gives a business direction. When a business has a strategy, even if it is loosely defined, it provides a reference point for all business activity. 

Strategies act like a compass and help to make sure that people all move in broadly the same direction. It means that you can make decisions locally, knowing that you are not going to upset wider business plans. This means that you can prioritise your business activity, and keep moving towards to end goal.

If the large arrow represents strategy, and the thin arrows represent operational decisions, you can see how even when decisions are not moving directly towards the end goal, they never move in the opposite direction.

If (for example) a business has a strategy of increasing its market share then most everyday decisions can be made with this in mind. For example:

- Should we increase our product range? (Yes - it will gain us more customers, which will in turn increase our market share)
- Should we consider moving overseas? (Maybe - this will almost certainly increase our market share by allowing us to reach more customers, but this must be balanced against the costs in delivering to that market)
- Should we make sure all of our staff have an NVQ level 3 in food hygiene? (Probably not - how will this increase our market share?)

### Culture

Culture is generally described as ‘the way we do things round here’, or the ‘personality’ of a business. It defines how the people within a business think, feel and act. If strategy defines WHAT the business aims to do, then culture will define HOW it will be done.

Values and structure often underpin a culture, and whilst culture can be shaped and changed over time, it is almost impossible to impose one. Culture underpins employee ‘fit’ and engagement and is evident in the way people behave, decision-making, and the approach to performance management.

### The Four Lenses

Managers who want to increase engagement levels within their areas of responsibility need to recognise that four levels of focus (or lenses) are necessary:

**I (me)**

This involves being fully engaged with yourself. It’s not possible to fully engage others if you are not fully engaged. It’s easy to abdicate the responsibility for your engagement to your manager or the organisation; however in reality, you are the only person who can make you engaged. This requires an understanding of yourself, your drivers, your strengths, weaknesses, working practices, etc.

**You (my colleague)**

Engage your people as individuals. Each person in your team is an individual and maximum engagement comes from that person being understood and treated as such.

**Us (our team)**

This is the wider group, your team (including you). Your team will require engagement techniques to maximise their performance and optimise the way they work together.

**All (the organisation)**

There is often a need to engage others outside your own direct sphere of influence (e.g. other departments; external partners; etc.). You have a part to play in the overall engagement and performance of your organisation. This will happen indirectly through the results of your behaviours with others whom you manage, and by association, their behaviour and interactions.

### Five Key Leadership Roles

In her book ‘The Culture Builders’, Jane Sparrow provides the theory and practice to connect employee engagement to long-term organisational performance. She states that, ‘To be a great engager, and have the capacity to deliver, a manager must master five fundamental roles and be able to recognise when each is appropriate and needed. The manager will need to move between them on a daily basis to achieve maximum engagement levels and thus performance in the team.’

These five roles are:
     
**The Prophet**

The Prophet is all about passion, vision and inspiration. Prophets paint a visual picture of the future in a highly emotive way that others can get hold of and want to be part of. At a leadership level, the prophet inspires people with passion, belief and clarity so that everyone in the organisation understands where they are going and what they stand for.
At a manager level, it’s about keeping the vision real, alive and never letting it fade. It could be about creating vision and purpose for a project, department or team. The critical parts of being a prophet are being passionate, aspirational and inspiring.

Great prophets find ways of connecting their personal purpose with the organisation’s purpose and direction and there is a deep passion for the future. They light people’s fires and make them want to understand how they are going to get there. The kind of words a prophet will use regularly are ‘dream’, ‘vision’, ‘purpose’, ‘stand’, ‘achieve’. Senior leaders as prophets don’t talk about the past; they talk about the future and how it’s exciting and achievable.

**The Storyteller**

The Storyteller uses a mix of emotion and logic to bring their story to life about how the vision and purpose will be achieved. They will answer such questions as:

- What does it look like?
- What does it feel like?
- What is the journey?
- What destinations will we pass?
- What does it mean for me as an individual and as a team?

Many organisations have internal communication departments which put lots of energy into storytelling around strategy; but it’s the manager who needs to keep the story alive every day and make it meaningful to people so that every person in their team doesn’t just know the story, they feel it’s their story.
Storytellers are masters of metaphors, competent at creating context and savvy at helping people see how their strengths contribute to the direction of the organisation.
 3. The Strategist
The Strategist has a plan to engage every person in their team. They know where the talent is in their team and have a retention and development plan for each of them. The strategist is the logical, rational part of being a manager that takes intention about engagement and makes it a reality.
Managers need a plan to motivate, enthuse and inspire their people. They need to be strong at putting that plan into action. In a highly purposeful or passionate culture, it’s often this role that’s in need of most attention.
 4. The Coach
The Coach understands what makes the individual’s heart beat and works with that knowledge and helps people to grow and deliver more value. A coach is the ‘people grower’, the nurturer.
Coaches ask the right questions rather than simply giving answers. The result is that they build their team members’ capacity and capability in a sustainable way rather than having quick fixes to problems. People feel valued and their engagement and performance levels soar.
Coaches nurture people to ensure that they bring the best of themselves to what they do. Managers are so busy ‘doing’ that they don’t have the desire, time or effort required to fulfil this role. Yet it’s the role that makes a sustainable difference. Coaches ask rather than tell. They coach formally and informally, giving insight ‘on the job’.
A senior leader as coach gives their managers the space to coach their people. They encourage it and role model it themselves by using a coaching style with their direct reports.

5. The Pilot
The Pilot is mindful, calm and balanced; the adult that won’t be running around in a panic. They are reassuring and confident, always knowing when to be authoritative and when to be facilitative.
Pilots are great at appreciating others. They trust their people and are trusted by others. Tone of voice and body language are used appropriately. They are consistent and do what they say they’ll do. Pilots are honest and give some of themselves to others - they don’t hide.
The three aspects of a pilot:
Authoritative: Leading from personal knowledge and belief with a strong sense of being right that gives them the confidence to direct others.
Inclusive: Leading using a facilitative style that regularly includes people in conversations about what’s happening and therefore what’s required. This gives them the certainty that they are making the right decisions.
Enabling: Taking the view that leadership is about providing stimulus and energy rather than firm guidance. They believe it’s their role to give people the space and time to take the direction they feel is right.

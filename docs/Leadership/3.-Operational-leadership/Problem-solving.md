# Problem solving

## Wisdom hierarchy

### What is it?
![Wisdom](/img/wisdom.png)

The Wisdom Pyramid is used to show the relationship between data, information, knowledge and wisdom to aid your decision-making ability.

### Why is it important?

What the model represents is that as Leader you are likely to have a range of data available to you, how you analyse and use that data will enable you to understand what it is telling you.
For example. the Data is there to give you the Information. By analysing the data and asking questions about it, this drives out the information enabling you to have knowledge about the situation.

That knowledge is often referred to as ‘the facts’ or possibly your ‘assumptions’ dependent on the data that you’re presented with.

With the knowledge, you are then able to make a decision because you understand ‘why’ you’re making that decision (i.e. the Wisdom). Over time your wisdom will grow as you face similar challenges because you’ll be armed with more data about the success of previous decisions and situations.

### How do we use it?

Simply follow the steps in the order given, using the most appropriate problem solving and decision making tools and techniques to suit the circumstances.

### What else?

The Pyramid has many different names: Knowledge Hierarchy, Information Hierarchy, and the Data Pyramid. If you’re struggling to make a decision, start at the bottom of the pyramid and work your way through. When you reach the top, you will have based your decision on the data you had, the information that gave you, the knowledge you then had. Over time, by following this process your legacy as a leader will be driven by the wisdom you have.

## Problem definition tools

The following tools can be used to help you define the problem clearly:

1. RAGE
2. The Five Whys
3. Systematic Problem Analysis - Is/Is Not 4. Define the Solved State
5. One Cycle Method


### RAGE

- R is for Reliable
- A is for Assumptions 
- G is for Goal
- E is for Example

Use the following questions to help you define the problem in detail:

**Reliable**

- What evidence is there to show that there is a problem? 
- How reliable is this information?
- Where did this information come from?

**Assumptions**

- What assumptions have you made?
- Have you missed anything?
- What else is likely to be true?
- What is implied here that may not be true?
- What else could explain the current situation?
- Is this the real problem - or just the symptom?
- Are you looking at just the surface of a much deeper problem?

**Goal**

- What exactly are you trying to achieve?
- What prevents you from achieving this?
- Why?
- What conditions will exist when the problem is solved? 
- What are the criteria of a successful solution?

**Example**

- Would an example of the problem make it clearer? 
- What would the opposite look like?
- What else is like this?

### The Five Whys

Asking the question ‘Why’ up to a maximum of five times should take you from the initial identification of the problem to a definition of the problem.

**Example:**
Q1: Why is our client unhappy?

A: Because we didn’t deliver our services when we said we would.

Q2: Why were we unable to meet the agreed deadline?

A: Because the job took much longer than we thought it would.

Q3: Why did it take so much longer?

A: Because we underestimated the complexity of the job.

Q4: Why did we underestimate the complexity of the job?

A: Because we made a quick estimate of the time needed to complete it, and didn’t list the individual stages needed to complete the project.

Q5: Why didn’t we do this?

A: Because we were running behind on other projects. We clearly need to review how we estimate time to complete projects.

### Systematic Problem Analysis - Is/Is Not

Use the following questions to help you define the problem in detail:

What is:

- What is the specific defect?
- What specific object/system(s) has the defect? 

What is not:

- What other defects could reasonably be observed, but are not?
- What similar object/system(s) could reasonably have the defect, but does not?

Where is:

- Where is the defective object/system observed (geographically)?
- Where is the defect on the object/system?

Where is not:

- Where else could the defective object/system be observed but is not?
- Where else could the defect be on the object/system, but is not?

When is:

- When was the defective object/system first observed (in clock/ calendar time)?
- When since that time, has the defective object/system been observed? Is there a pattern in this?
- When in the object/system’s life cycle or history, was the defect first observed?

When is not:

- When else could the defective object/system have been first observed but was not?
- When else could the defective object/system have been observed but was not?
- When else could the defect have been first observed in the object/system’s life cycle but was not?

Extent is:

- How many objects/systems have the defect? 
- What is the size of a single defect? 
- How many defects are on each object/system? 
- What has been the trend?

Extent is not:

- How many objects/systems could have the defect but do not?
- What other size could the defect be but is not?
- How many defects could there be on each object/ system but are not?
- What other trends could have been expected but were not observed?

### Define the solved state

Write down a five-sentence description of the problem in terms of ‘The following should be happening, but isn’t...’ or ‘The following is happening and should be:...’ As much as possible, be specific in your description, including what is happening, where, how, with whom and why. If the problem seems really complex, break it down until you have descriptions of several related problems.

Some helpful questions:

- What is the problem?
- Where is it happening?
- How is it happening?
- When is it happening?
- With whom is it happening?
- Why is it happening?
- Is it our problem?
- Can I solve it?
- Is it worth solving?
- Is this the real problem or merely a symptom of a larger one?
- If this is an old problem, what’s wrong with the previous solution?
- Does it need an immediate solution or can it wait?
- Is it likely to go away by itself?
- Can we risk ignoring it?
- Does the problem have ethical dimensions?
- What conditions must the solution satisfy?
- Will the solution affect...?
- What can you see that causes you to think there’s a problem?

### One cycle method (card sorting)

**Step mne - label making**

Collect all of the facts and information relevant to the problem and write each fact on a separate label or sticky note.

**Step Two - label grouping**

- Shuffle the labels, spread them out and read them again.
- Collate the labels in logical groups - leave those for now which do not seem to ft anywhere. For each group, write a suitable title/heading and place it at the top of each group.
- Refer to the unallocated labels and see if they can form a ‘higher level’ group with one or more of the groups already identified.
- Repeat this process until the total number of groups is less than ten.

**Step three - chart making**

- Arrange the final groups into the most appropriate spatial pattern to give a total understanding of the groups.
- Describe the relationships between different groups using symbols.
- Transfer the information to a large sheet of paper and arrange sub-groups in the same way to build up an overall picture of the problem.

## Urgency vs importance

### What is it?

The Urgency vs Importance Grid was highlighted in Stephen Covey’s book ‘7 habits of highly effective people’. It compares the urgency of a task with its importance and enables tasks to be prioritised accordingly.

### Why is it important?

It is often tempting to be distracted by highly urgent tasks which are of little importance important? at the expense of more important tasks which do not have the same pressing deadlines. The effective time manager has an acute understanding of what’s important and schedules their time and attention accordingly.

### How do we use it?

Consider your current workload and systematically assess it by asking how urgent and important each task is. Then make decisions about each task using the following guidelines:

1. **High Importance and Low Urgency** - these are tasks that contribute to the achievement of your objectives and they should be given sufficient attention to complete. Since time is not pressing, these are the tasks that should be given time-slots in your diary. These are the ‘Should Do’ tasks.
2. **High Importance and High Urgency** - these are high priority tasks that must be done now - the ‘Must Do’ tasks
3. **Low Importance and High Urgency** - these are less important tasks that need to be completed soon - these could perhaps be delegated to someone else. You should ask yourself, “If it’s not important, then should it be done at all?” If it is a task that has to be completed, make time in your diary to do it within the deadline.
4. **Low Importance and Low Urgency** - these are the trivial tasks that can so often distract you. Again, if they are of low importance you should question the need to do them at all. If they do need to be completed, then perhaps you can delegate them to one of your team or keep them for yourself as time-fillers - tasks that can be completed quickly and easily, for example, when you are waiting for a meeting to start.

### What else?

When faced with too much work, use the following questions to sift through your workload and to help you to make decisions about where to focus your attention.

The real question is not what priority something is, but whether it should be done at all!

### Key questions

- Do I have to do this work today?
- Do I have to do this work now?
- Do I have to do this work at all?
- If I do this work, what would I have to delay or abandon?
- Who else could do this work?
- What would happen if no-one did this work?
- How does this work relate to my key tasks and objectives?
- Who else is involved with, or affected by this task?

## Effective planning

The first step in effective planning is having clarity about your goals - successful planning will help you to achieve them. Many people find planning boring or claim they don’t have enough time. Others spend all their time planning and little time doing. Whatever your approach to planning, it is worth taking some time to ensure that the job is achieved to the right standard and on time. Planning gives you an opportunity to think through the detail.

Some key points to consider:

- Balance stability with flexibility
- Recognise how much of your time you can plan
- Consider how far ahead you can usefully plan
- Too much planning = inflexibility; No planning = no roots

### Medium to long term planning

Medium term: 2-6 months, long term: 6-12 months or longer.

1. Identify your long-term goals to give you direction
2. Break large goals down into smaller, more manageable chunks and plan these in your diary
3. Review your performance regularly and modify your plans accordingly
4. Don’t over-plan or over-commit yourself - if you can only plan 40% of your time, you should only be accounting for 40% of time in your planning
5. Remain ﬂexible in your planning
6. Use monthly/annual planning charts to help you
7. When planning ahead in your diary, don’t just put in fixed appointments and meetings, plan those other tasks which are going to be placing a demand on your time
8. Look ahead for times when there might be a conﬂict between different priorities, problems and busy/quiet periods
9. If you are over-committed, consider delegating some of your tasks
10. By having a fairly good picture of your workload over the next four weeks, you are in a better position to say no to some of those additional tasks
11. Use your imagination to work out the various options and possibilities available to you
12. Think of medium/long-term planning in the same way that a good driver is aware of what is going on 100 metres ahead, as well as right in front of the car’s bonnet.

### Short-term planning

Days or weeks.

However, effective your medium/long-term planning is, it will fail you if you don’t build it in to your short-term plans. Some people like to plan each new day at the end of the previous day, some at the start of the day and some do not plan the day at all. The problem of not planning the day is that the day can end up managing you, rather than you managing it. However, don’t become a slave to your diary plan or to-do list - it is only a guide and may require changing as the day progresses.

When planning the day:

1. Consider your own body clock - plan to do the jobs that require maximum concentration when you are at your best
2. Plan your day as far as possible but leave room for unexpected activities
3. Give yourself planning time first thing to set up the day or at the end of the day to wind down
4. Make a list of the things you have to do for each activity - prioritise these tasks and give them a start and finish time
5. Mark ‘Prime Time’ in your diary - this is time for you to work uninterrupted on important tasks
6. Avoid going straight from one meeting to another if you can - a late finish to the first meeting will affect the next one
7. Allow time to physically get to appointments and make sure that you take notes during any meetings
8. Prioritise your telephone calls and make a number of calls together
9. If you are required to read, give yourself periods of reading time on a regular basis - it may seem a luxury but don’t feel guilty if it is part of your job
10. Always try to finish the day on a positive note - this will send you home in a good mood and help you approach the next day feeling positive.

### Prime time

‘Prime Time’ reinforces personal commitment and concentration and it acts as a barrier to low priority interruptions by others. Because it has a beginning and an end, and because it can be programmed into your diary in advance, it is the least disruptive way in which an individual can assert their right to their own time. It is an important step away from reactive and stressful crisis management - it is a method of taking control of your own time to achieve what you know to be the most important elements of your job.

Before setting prime time:

1. Set a personal goal for what you want to achieve - what will be a successful output from the time you have invested?
2. Decide when you can most conveniently work alone and for how long
3. Decide where you can go to minimise interruptions and distractions
4. Set in place as many contingency plans as you feel are necessary to avoid people interrupting you
5. Tell people when you will be unavailable and for how long
6. Prepare all the materials and information you will need to complete the task.

At the end of prime time:

1. Review what you have achieved - have you used the time well? Have you completed the task more quickly or to a better standard than you would normally?
2. Ensure you allocate time to contact anyone who wanted to see you while you were unavailable
3. Be prepared to continue working (after a short break if necessary) if there is more to do and there are no other immediate demands on your time.
